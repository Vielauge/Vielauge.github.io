## English settings
To do a blog is a while on my todo-list. So here we go.

This my first blog post. Do not judge my english too hard. I am not a native speaker, and although my english is almost fluent,
depending on day time, brain fog, audience, speaking or writing and other mysterious independent variables,
there are mistakes and a lot of missing vocabulary. I struggled a lot with languages in school. My expertise is and was more on the numbers.

You can find more about me in the "About" section.
